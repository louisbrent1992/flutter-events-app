## Project Overview

**Purpose:** This app is designed for home cooks, food enthusiasts, and anyone looking for culinary inspiration. It leverages AI to create personalized recipes based on user inputs and provides a platform for managing and sharing recipes.

## Core Features

### A. AI-Generated Recipe Creation

- Users can specify ingredients, dietary restrictions, and cuisine types.
- If no inputs are provided, the app will use default random values for ingredients, dietary restrictions, and cuisine types.
- Integration with an AI service to generate recipes based on user inputs.
- Customization options for cooking time, difficulty level, and nutritional information.

### B. Recipe Management

- CRUD operations for personal recipe collections.
- Categorization and tagging of recipes.
- Favorites and bookmarks for quick access.
- Search and filter functionality.

### C. Social Media Recipe Import

- Deep linking to handle shared social media content.
- Parsing engine to extract recipe details from social media posts.
- Validation and editing of imported data.
- Direct integration with Instagram to retrieve captions and images.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Flutter (Dart)
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express
- **Database:** In-memory storage (for demo purposes)
- **AI Integration:** External AI service (e.g., OpenAI)
- **State Management:** Provider
- **External APIs:** RocketAPI for Instagram content

## Getting Started

To get started with the Flutter Recipe App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flutter-recipe-app.git
   cd flutter-recipe-app
   ```

2. Navigate to the client directory and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd client
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Run the app:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

4. For the backend, navigate to the server directory and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

5. Set up environment variables:

   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required API keys.

6. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Instagram Integration

This app integrates with Instagram posts to extract recipe information from captions. To set up the Instagram integration:

1. Sign up for a RapidAPI key at [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/)
2. Subscribe to the [RocketAPI for Developers](https://rapidapi.com/rocketapi-rocketapi-default/api/rocketapi-for-developers/)
3. Add your API key to the `.env` file as `RAPID_API_KEY`

To test the Instagram integration:

```bash
cd server
node test-instagram.js https://www.instagram.com/p/SHORTCODE/
```

The integration allows the app to:

- Extract captions from Instagram posts
- Retrieve the image from the post
- Process the caption with AI to identify recipe details
- Create a recipe entry with metadata from Instagram

## Social Sharing Integration

The app supports seamless recipe sharing through iOS and Android share extensions:

### Share Handler Integration
- **Enhanced Sharing**: Uses the `share_handler` package for robust sharing functionality
- **Multiple Content Types**: Supports URLs, text, images, videos, and various file types
- **Share Suggestions**: Provides intelligent share suggestions for better user experience
- **Cross-Platform**: Works consistently across iOS and Android platforms

### How It Works
1. Users can share recipe URLs from any app (Safari, Instagram, etc.)
2. The share extension captures the shared content automatically
3. The app processes the shared URL and extracts recipe information
4. Users can review and save the imported recipe to their collection

## Firebase Integration

The app uses Firebase for authentication and data storage:

### Setup Instructions
1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Enable Authentication (Email/Password and Google sign-in)
3. Enable Cloud Firestore
4. Deploy security rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore`

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter permissions issues:
- Ensure Firestore security rules are deployed
- Verify collection paths match between code and rules
- Confirm user authentication before accessing protected data
